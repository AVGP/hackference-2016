  Technical Team Solutions IT Recruitment agency is Co-run by Hannah Mitchell and Andy Jones. They are a successful and forward thinking duo with over 15 years of industry experience. However, they bring more to the party than experience and expertise; they are also firm believers in doing things differently. They steer clear of the standard ‘recruitment’ processes, placing their clients and customers firmly at the heart of everything they do. They understand not everyone wants to work the same way, so they create a tailored approach for each client.

  They have helped create awesome teams from scratch and supported the companies and employees to ensure they achieved continued growth and development. Technical Team Solutions are also able to advise customers on current market trends and the IT Recruitment market and how it changes from month to month. They see daily the profound impact technology has on the world around us, and it’s an industry they are genuinely excited to be a part of.

  They are co-founders of Fusion; one of Birmingham’s most dynamic Tech Meet-Ups, and we sponsor a number of other events too including Brum Hack, Hackference and are the exclusive recruitment partner of Silicon Canal.

  Both Hannah and Andy are invested in the Birmingham Tech scene and regularly support local initiatives to put Birmingham firmly on the ‘Tech Hub’ map
