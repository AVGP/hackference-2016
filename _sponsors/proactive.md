  We are pleased to announce the support of Proactive as a sponsor.

  Proactive is the “go to” solution for Devs and Designers who need proper help with their accounts and tax returns. And their prices are highly competitive!

  Operating strictly as a business to business provider, the team of accountants and book keepers likes to focus on getting things done. They can handle year end accounts, tax returns and VAT returns quickly and cleanly, and with a minimum of fuss.

  Proactive has been running a paperless office since 1 April 2008. How did they do that? Well if you’ve met @ProactivePaul you’ll know he’s a coder on the side! Being paperless makes your relationship with the accountant quicker, easier and cheaper, which is surely something you’d be interested in!

  Keep an eye out for more info from Proactive later this year. They'll be offering a discount to attendees of Hackference 2016. And as usual, they'll be putting up some interesting prizes in the Hackathon!
