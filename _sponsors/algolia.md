  Algolia is proud to be a supporter of Hackference 2016! Algolia is an API for building fast, engaging search experiences. We have API clients for all major languages and frameworks, complete with open source JavaScript libraries for building autocomplete and search-as-you-type interfaces. Our team is in Paris and San Francisco and our developer community comes from all over the world. Our mission is to connect people with what theyâ€™re searching for and empower others to do the same. Hope to see you this year in Birmingham!
