				<p class="big-intro">Now in its fourth year, the Hackference Conference portion is being held in its most beautifully unique venue yet! We are taking over <a href="https://www.theelectric.co.uk/">The Electric</a> in Birmingham, to have an amazing cast of speakers cover a full spectrum of topics. From languages and paradigms to API's and hobby projects, there is something for everyone. So if you are new to programming and computers, an industry expert or anywhere inbetween the two - you do not want to miss out.</p>
				<p class="big-intro">As usual, we'll make sure you will have the best conference lunch you'll ever have, enough snacks and drinks to keep your mind fresh, lots of chances for networking and free entry into our amazing after-party. And you'll get priority tickets to our legendary <a href="/hackathon.html" ><strong>Hackathon</strong></a> when those tickets are released!</p>
