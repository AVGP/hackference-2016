title: Why not sponsor Hackference

<h1>Sponsorship Packages</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Hackference</strong> is three unique days designed around Learning, Building and Sharing, taking place in two venues across central Birmingham.
  With over <strong>300 attendees</strong> over the course of the three days, the attendees will get exposure to fantastic talks, in-depth workshops at our conference and a valueable experience of building during the weekend over at the hackathon.

<h2>Who attends Hackference?</h2>
<p>We're lucky at Hackference to have a diverse mixture of attendees - previous event's have had plenty of student, startup, corporate and freelance attendees from all over the skill spectrum. Although we love local developers and designers, we are even more lucky to have such a large number of them travel in from across the country.</p>
<p>The majority of our speakers are renowed on a national level - and some, international - and travel to us from all across the world. They are active on social media, and usually have a very large following as they are considered trendsetters, influencers and brand promoters.</p>
<p>A rough breakdown of attendees would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>50% Student, Junior Developers and Hobbyists</li>
  <li>30% Mid Level Developers and Designers</li>
  <li>20% Senior Developer and Architects</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the languages used at the Hackathon, we can assume they are mostly Web and Mobile App Developers</p>
