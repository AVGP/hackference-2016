  Lua is a very fast, elegant and powerful dynamic language. It’s an excellent tool for robust applications or slim embedded systems. It found a niche in game development with big names such as “Grim Fandango”, “World of Warcraft” and “Angry Birds”. This talk will present what makes Lua different from other interpreted languages, the evolution of the Lua ecosystem, some key concepts of the language, and show you why Lua is the next language to add to your skill set.
