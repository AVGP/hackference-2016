  *WebAudio*

  WebAudio is a powerful high-level API for playing, processing and generating audio, making it possible to make sounds and music right in the browser, in plain JS and with no plugins.

  When used with WebMIDI and Canvas, it is possible to create dynamic interactive experiences, visualizing sound and controlling it from any MIDI capable instrument or controller.

  *Basics of Digital Sound Synthesis*

  WebAudio provides an interface similar to “traditional” audio processing and synthesis so we’ll cover the basics of sounds from wave frequencies and amplitudes, to oscillators, audio effects and signal routing. The WebAudio building blocks are highly modular and once you understand the flow of audio signals you can make almost anything come out of the speakers.

  *Play, Process, Synthesize*

  Stream audio from SoundCloud, add effects, equalize and manipulate the stream, synthesize sound and create music from scratch. It’s all possible with different components of the WebAudio API. Making them all work together, you can build intricate devices that don’t fall short of other “real” synthesizers and audio players.

  *Control and Visualize*

  Finally, by hooking up audio to the MIDI API we can control parameters and playback from a MIDI controller and visualize the sonic creation in a canvas-driven audio visualizer.
