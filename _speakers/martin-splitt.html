  Martin is pretty decent at humaning and pretty good at computering,
  so he decided to use his computering to improve his and other's humaning.

  He loves the open web and open source and helps to make things better with, but not limited to, code.
talk_title: Building interactive 3D worlds in the browser with WebGL
talk_abstract: |

  *What’s this about?*
  Thanks to the wide adoption and availability of WebGL across browsers (including those on mobile) we get control of the full graphics pipeline.

  After understanding WebGL basics and the render pipeline, you’ll learn what Three.js brings to the table and you’ll get a live coding demonstration you can code along to in which we’ll build a 3D web app from the ground up with all elements: Lighting, loading 3D models and keyboard/mouse controls

  *What’s in this talk?*

  In this talk there’s gonna be an introduction into 3D and WebGL basics, live coding demonstration and a bunch of tips & tricks on how to tweak performance and perceived performance & quality.

  You’ll learn how to build 3D games and applications that run without any plugin right from the browser - even on mobile. You’ll see how you can start creating this content today and how to bring it to production quality.

  *Topics*

  - Introduction: CPU vs. GPU - Canvas vs. WebGL
  - 3D Vocabulary: Vertices, Faces, Shaders and their friends
  - WebGL 101
  - Live coding introduction into Three.js
  - Performance pitfalls
  - Making things prettier
  - Outlook: WebGL 2.0 and beyond
