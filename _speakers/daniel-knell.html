talk_title: Email - Beyond the Send Button
talk_abstract: |

  As developers we spend a lot of time focused on HTTP, yet there is an older protocol that is just as important and often not very well understood. Join me for a trip down the rabbit hole and learn just how much is hidden by our email clients and libraries.

  We will follow an email transaction as it leaves its home client/library, navigates the email exchanges and the quagmire of new security / anti-spam features, and then eventually makes its way to the receiver.

  Along the way we will look at the various features that protect the modern inbox, as well as the ones that are going to play a big roll in deliverability over the coming year, and how we as developers can play nicely with them to ensure the best chance of our mail reaching its targets.
